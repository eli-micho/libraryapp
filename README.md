# libraryapp

## Introduction

This project idea is taken from the Odin Project Javascript cirriculum ([Link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library)). The idea is to simulate a virtual library by creating a simple app where users
input information about a book (i.e. title, author, no. of pages and whether they've read it or not). The app then takes this info and stores the data
in it's collection. Currently this is done using local storage.
